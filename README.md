An homage to Dinahmoe's Plink

When looking for something other than a chat server to impplement using HTML5 Web Sockets,
I came across Plink, by the Swedish compnay DinahMoe, and so ripped-off the idea for fun.

The server code is simply for demo purposes, basically a chat server.

`writeup/` contains the notes I wrote as I wrote the code.
