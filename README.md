An homage to Dinahmoe's Plink

When looking for something other than a chat server to impplement using HTML5 Web Sockets,
I came across Plink, by the Swedish compnay DinahMoe, and so ripped-off the idea for fun.

This repo contains all my personal files, not really sorted into any public-friendly form,
but perhaps useful.

The client is written with MooTools, though MT isn't really suited to sockets or
the Web Audio API (despite my offer of a patch).

The server code is simply
for demo purposes, basically a chat server, and comes in two versions, node.js, and Perl Mojolicious.

`index.html` should give a good idea of how to use the client, and both the Perl and Node code is straight-forward.
