<H2 CLASS="western">Sunday</H2>
<P>When looking for something to impplement using HTML5 Web Sockets,
other than a chat server, I came across Plink, by the Swedish compnay
DinahMoe, and so ripped-off the idea.</P>
<P>When watching Plink, it seemed obvious to implement it as ... a
chat server, in as much a number of users are linked to a
persistent-state server, that relays each users messages to all other
users, in real time. The interesting thing about Plink is that the
messages are musical sounds.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Monday: Relay Server</H2>
<P>The first task was to write or find a
Web Socket relay server. Node.js seemed the obvious choice, but
support for Web Sockets in Node.js is patchy, and as I wanted to play
with the latest version of the specification, I had only the
web-socket library to look at. Unfortunately, this failed to build on
OS X, and the support response was 'your need Xcode,' which I have
had since buying the Mac.</P>
<P>I thought of trolling through the Maven
repositories for something suitable, but on my way there checked what
Perl had to offer. After getting side-tracked by the usual Perl
half-baked or badly documented implementations, I found that
Mojolicious has a simple WS daemon that can run out of the box. It
took literally five minutes to install the package and have the relay
up and running – a fraction of the time it took to find the
library.</P>
<P><BR>

<P>#!/usr/bin/perl 
</P>
<P>use strict;</P>

<P>};</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>app-&gt;start; 
</P>
<P>__END__</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The code simply receives a CSV of three
numbers representing the cursor position and selected pitch, which it
stores for each connected client.  Every time a client sends this
information, the server responds with the latest copy of the
information for all clients.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Prototype 1</H3>
<P>The first stage of the prototype was boiler plate – setting up
an Apache virtual server, creating directories to hold JS and CSS,
and a basic HTML5 document to pull in Mootools, Modernizer, the blank
application CSS file, and a fresh Mootools class definition, the
latter linked to an element in the body of the page into which the
app could insert itelf.</P>
<P>Capturing mouse movement events is straight forward, and once
their offsets are removed, I was ready to send the co-ordinates to
the server. When jotting down the server code, above, I had already
decided to send both co-ordinates and pitch information, as I wasn't
quite sure how I would implement the functionality of the app, and
wanted to leave my options open. I've been a victim of premature
optimisation in the past.</P>
<P>Next I had to find the Web Socket API. There are many examples of
this lying around the net, and it took only a minute to implement the
necessary callbacks, and have the server logging connections and
messages, and the client console logging what it was sending and
receiving.</P>
<P>After adding to my websocket .message callback some code to render
a circle at the co-ordinates specified in the message, I could see a
mess under my cursor whenever I moved it.</P>
<P>Next came my only implementation error – at least, the only one
I have noticed.</P>
<P>Plink shows the current note the user is playing as a circle on
the screen, but also shows past notes as scrolling horizontally away
from the cursor: very pretty. I remember implementing horizontal
scrolling for games on a Vic-20 in the early 1980s, and the fastest
way of doing it then was to shift a block of memory by the number of
bytes to be scrolled, an operation easily and quickly done even then,
by a ten-year old.</P>
<P>HTML5 is not so simple, and the canvas element still lacks a
built-in scrolling function. This left four choices: two involved
dropping the canvas, in favour of either SVG or WebGL; I've played
with both, and found basic operation in both to be similarly
straight-forward: in both cases, I would for every 'note' create an
object that could be rendered. The other option was to do this for
the canvas, and wipe it between every rendering, or to attempt to
copy the canvas element, wipe the original, and render the copy one
pixel to the left.</P>
<P>My thoughts were that the latter would be the simplest, and
closest to the pattern I had learnt as a kid.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>	scroll: function(){</P>
<P>		var destinationCanvas = this.canvas.clone()</P>
<P>		destinationCanvas.cloneEvents( this.canvas, 'mousemove');</P>
<P>		var destCtx = destinationCanvas.getContext('2d');</P>
<P>		destCtx.drawImage(</P>
<P>			this.canvas, 
</P>
<P>			(this.options.scrollPx)*-1, 
</P>
<P>			0</P>
<P>		);</P>
<P>		destinationCanvas.replaces( this.canvas );</P>
<P>		this.canvas.destroy();</P>
<P>		this.canvas = destinationCanvas;</P>
<P>		this.ctx		= destCtx;</P>
<P>	},</P>
<P>	</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>I hooked the above method up to a timer, via Mootools .periodial
method, and was mildly pleased to see a trail from cursor,
disappearing off the edge of my screen. 
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Prototype 2 
</H2>
<P>Before the day ended, I wanted to hear sounds, and as I browsed
for API notes and implementation examples, I noticed my fan buzzing,
and Mozilla getting sluggish. I flicked, slowly, through my tabs, and
found the Plink rip-off crawling. I killed the server, closed the
tab, and everything was fine. I still don't know exactly what the
problem was: I tried minimising the rate messages were sent to the
server, and the frequency of canvas renderings, but in the end went
to have tea, and gave up for the day.</P>
<H1 CLASS="western">Tuesday</H1>
<P>For some reason I felt an attachment to the canvas copying method,
but dropped it all the same, and had the .message handler push the
latest batch of JSON objects onto a stack. I then rewrote the
periodical scroll method to render everything on the stack, making
the latest object appear on the right, decrementing everything by one
cursor width, and dropping from the stack anything that would fall
the screen. This removed the performance problem, and reinforced my
desire for a native canvas.scroll method.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Web Audio API</H2>
<P>In my experiments writing an audio sequencer for SoundCloud files,
I learn the limitations of the HTML5 audio element – it is to the
Audio API as the video element is to the Web Graphics Library. So, I
found a decent introduction to the Audio API, on HTML5Doctor, and had
sound within a few minutes, hooked up in a new periodical method. I
had the .send method calculate pitch by computing within which of a
number zones the vertical position of the mouse fell, and then spent
an hour find sounds in Logic, and exporting individual notes as wav
files, loaded into buffers stored in arrays, whose indexes could be
accessed by the 'pitch' index sent to the server.</P>
<P>Plink has a percussion track, so I extended the sound-firing
method to play the drums as appropriate:</P>
<P>	options: {</P>
<P>	…</P>
<P>		percussion: {</P>
<P>			kick:  [[4,1]],</P>
<P>			snare: [[8,1], [16,2]],</P>
<P>			hat_closed: []</P>
<P>		}</P>
<P>	}</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>		self.percNames.each( function(instrument){</P>
<P>			self.options.percussion[instrument].each( function(i){</P>
<P>				console.log( instrument +' '+ self.pulseNumber +' '+ i[0] +'
'+i[1]);</P>
<P>				if (self.pulseNumber % i[0] == i[1]){</P>
<P>					self.playNow( self.percBuffers[instrument] );</P>
<P>					self.scaleCursor += self.options.cursorScaleIncrement;</P>
<P>				}</P>
<P>			});</P>
<P>		});</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>Notice that routine also changes the cursor size, as in Plink, so
the visual echo of the sound reflects the unerlying rhythm.</P>
<P>My children then took over the development machine for beta
testing, and I joined in on the old media centre PC, on which I had
to install Chrome, which seems to be the only limitation of the
project, other than my inability to find a free host for my
web-socket relay code: my current ISP is too cheap to provide this.</P>
<P>I was quite pleased with the effort, and dropped a line to the
address Dinahmoe publicised for job applicants, but no word yet:
perhaps they realise Plink isn't that hard to do. Whilst I was there
I had a quite look at the Plink source code, and was only mildly
horrified, mainly by the amount of hard-coding, lack of framework,
and lack of white-space. 
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Wednesday</H2>
<P>I then added the ability to change patches, as in Plink, as well
as some options to have the horizontal cursor position equate to
volume and panning – two options the children found far from
intuitive, and quite intrusive into their play.</P>
<P>Also added the ability for patches to only sound if pre-required,
much in the manner of the percussion track.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Next</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Move the patches into objects, for ease of legibility and
	maintenance.</P>
	<LI><P>Maybe switch to WebGl, just for fun. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Find a way of playing like this for money.</P>
